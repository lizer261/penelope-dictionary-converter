# StarDict #

_StarDict_ support is included since it is a very popular format for
dictionaries on e-book readers. Some readers directly support _StarDict_,
so it is just a natural outcome for _[Penelope](Penelope.md)_ to include _StarDict_
as both a input and output format.

For the _StarDict_ format, please check out _[StarDict\_format](StarDict_format.md)_
and for more information on _StarDict_ visit the current
_[StarDict-3](http://code.google.com/p/stardict-3/)_ project on _GoogleCode_.
