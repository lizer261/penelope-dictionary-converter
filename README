Penelope

Penelope is a utility that allows you to format a dictionary for the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey e-reader.

With the current version (v. 1.04, 2012-03-07) you can convert a Stardict or XML dictionary into the Odyssey format, and define your own parser for each word/definition.

Future versions will include support for more advanced XML input parsing and for merging multiple input dictionaries into a single one.

Please have a look at this web page for details: http://www.dei.unipd.it/~pettarin/penelope.html

If you want to contribute some code or you have suggestions, please let me know by sending an email to pettarin AT gmail ... containing the word "Penelope" in the subject. Thanks!
