Penelope

Penelope is a utility that allows you to format a dictionary for
the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey e-reader.

With the current version (v. 1.06, 2012-11-29) you can convert
a Stardict or XML dictionary into the Odyssey format,
and define your own parser for each word/definition.

Future versions will include support for merging multiple input dictionaries into a single one, and for generating an EPUB file to "fake" a search function, currently not implemented in the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey eReader.

Please have a look at this web page for details:

If you want to contribute some code or you have suggestions,
please let me know by sending an email to pettarin AT gmail ...
containing the word "Penelope" in the subject. Thanks!
