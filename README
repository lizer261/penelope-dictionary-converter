Penelope is a utility that allows you to format a dictionary for
the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey or for Kobo eReaders.

With the current version (v. 1.13, 2012-12-28) you can convert
a Stardict or XML dictionary into the Odyssey or Kobo or Stardict formats,
and define your own parser for each word/definition.

Future versions will include support for merging
multiple input dictionaries into a single one,
and for generating an EPUB file to "fake" a search function,
currently not implemented in the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey eReader.

Please have a look at this web page for details:
