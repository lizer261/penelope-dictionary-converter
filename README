Penelope

Penelope is a utility that allows you to format a dictionary for
the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey e-reader.

With the current version (v. 1.06, 2012-11-29) you can convert
a Stardict or XML dictionary into the Odyssey format,
and define your own parser for each word/definition.

Future versions will include support for merging
multiple input dictionaries into a single one,
and for generating an EPUB file to "fake" a search function,
currently not implemented in the Bookeen Cybook Odyssey eReader.

Please have a look at this web page for details:

If you want to contribute some code or you have suggestions,
please let me know by sending an email to pettarin AT gmail ...
containing the word "Penelope" in the subject. Thanks!

*IMPORTANT NOTE (2012-11-28):*
the current code requires Python 2.6 or Python 2.7.
It does *not* run under Python 3.
If you download the current code and modify it
to run under Python 3, please share it!
I will be glad to give you access to this project
so that you could upload your Python 3 code,
and make many other people happy!
(You can just write me an email with the code, if you prefer.)

*ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:*
many thanks to _uwelovesdonna_ for contributing ideas
for improving the code, and for setting up
many pages of the project wiki.
