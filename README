Penelope is a multi-tool for creating, editing and converting dictionaries, especially for eReader devices.

With the current version (v. 1.15, 2013-01-10) you can:
  * convert a dictionary FROM/TO the following formats:
    * Bookeen Cybook Odyssey
    * Kobo
    * StarDict
    * XML
    * CSV
  * define your own parser for each word/definition
  * generate an EPUB file containing the index of a given dictionary (e.g., to cope with the lack of a search function on your eReader)

Future versions will include support for merging
multiple input dictionaries into a single one.

Please have a look at this web page for details:

----

The current version runs both under Python 2 or Python 3,
and it has been tested under Linux (Debian, Fedora) and Windows (XP, 7).
Unfortunately, since I do not have any financial support for the project,
I cannot offer support for all the possibile
values of the tuple (OS, Python version, console encoding).
Therefore, only problems running Penelope in a Linux environment
will receive full priority.

If you want to contribute some code or you have suggestions,
please let me know by sending an email to pettarin AT gmail ...
containing the word "Penelope" in the subject. Thanks!
